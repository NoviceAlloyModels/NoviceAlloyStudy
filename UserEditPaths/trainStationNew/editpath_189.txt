inv1 S: some entry and some exit
inv1 C: some Entry and some Exit
inv2 S: all s : Signal, one t : Track | s in t.signals
inv2 C: all s : Signal | one t : Track | s in t.signals
inv3 T: all e : Exit | none e.succs
inv3 U: all e : Exit | no e.succs
inv3 U: all e : Exit | (# e.succs) = 0
inv3 C: all t : Track | #(t.succs) = 0 iff t in Exit
inv4 O: all t1,t2 : Track | t1 in Entry iff t1 not in t2.succs
inv4 C: all t : Track |  #(succs.t) = 0 iff t in Entry
inv5 C: all t : Track | #(succs.t) > 1 iff t in Junction
inv5 C: all t : Track | #(succs.t) > 1 iff t in Junction
inv6 B: all e : Entry | Speed in e.signals
inv6 S: all t : Track | Speed in e.signals iff t in Entry
inv6 B: all t : Track |  t in Entry implies Speed in t.signals
inv6 C: all e : Entry | some s : Speed | s in e.signals
inv7 U: all t : Track | t not in t.succs
inv7 T: all t : Track | t not in ^t.succs
inv7 S: all t : Track | t not in t.succs^
inv7 S: all t : Track | t not in t.^succ
inv7 C: all t : Track | t not in t.^succs
inv9 C: all t : Track | no (t.succs & Junction) implies  no (Semaphore & t.signals)
