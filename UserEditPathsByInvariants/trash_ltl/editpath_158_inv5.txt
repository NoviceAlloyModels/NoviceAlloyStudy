inv5 B: some f : File | eventually f in Trash
inv5 B: some f : File | f in Trash implies eventually File' = File - f
inv5 O: some f : Trash | eventually File' = File - f
inv5 O: some f : File | eventually File' = File - f
inv5 O: eventually (some f : File | File' = File - f)
inv5 O: eventually (some f : File | f not in File)
inv5 O: some f : File | eventually f not in File
inv5 O: eventually (some f : File | f not in File)
inv5 C: eventually (some f : File | after f not in File)
