inv9 S: all a,b:Track|b in Junction and b->a in succs implies all s:Semaphores| a->s in signals
inv9 B: all a,b:Track|b in Junction and b->a in succs implies all s:Semaphore| a->s in signals
inv9 B: all a,b:Track|b in Junction and b->a not in succs implies all s:Semaphore| a->s not in signals
inv9 B: all a,b:Track|b in Junction and a->b not in succs implies all s:Semaphore| a->s not in signals
inv9 B: all a,b:Track|b in Junction and a->b not in succs implies all s:Semaphore| a->s not in signals
inv9 B: all a,b:Track|b in Junction and a->b not in succs implies all s:Semaphore| a->s not in signals
