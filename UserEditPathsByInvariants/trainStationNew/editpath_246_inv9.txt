inv9 B: all t : Track, s : Semaphore | Junction not in succs.t implies s not in t.signals
inv9 B: all t : Track, j : Junction, s : Semaphore| (j not in t.succs) implies (s not in t.signals)
inv9 B: all t : Track, s : Semaphore | Junction not in succs.t implies s not in t.signals
inv9 B: all t : Track| Junction not in t.succs implies Semaphore not in t.signals
inv9 C: all t : Track| no (t.succs & Junction) implies no (Semaphore & t.signals)
